## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

Reading the article reinforced the idea that reading is an essential tool used by SuperLearners. I think I do read a fair amount, but the quality of my reading could use some improvement, i.e. books over articles. I think I need to really focus on my attention to detail. I think the one large thing I would add to the list would be consistency. Whether reading, attention to detail, or spotting differences, all of it requires consistency.
