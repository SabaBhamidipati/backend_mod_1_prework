## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  The following points from the article resonated with me:
  - Setting S.M.A.R.T. goals helps approach learning to code with clarity and focus.
  - Believing that i can improve my cording skills with effort and practice, because growth mindset
    is associated with mastery and learning oriented behaviors

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  I think I demonstrate growth mindset currently by pushing myself to go as deep as I can in each
  section. As I get closer to the deadline, and I realize that I may need more time, on occasion I
  solve for time over content. But for the vast majority of my time, I've been digging into as many of the details as possible, googling information, trying new strategies outside of what the
  immediate task prescribes.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
  Hashes and Arrays are both indexed collections in Ruby. However, an Array is a list of data in a particular order, which can be called using that order. Data added or removed must also be done with the order prescribed. A Hash on the other hand is a list of data that does not have a particular order. It can contain any type of data, and it is a closer representation of object oriented programming because you can group all relevant data related to an object, within a particular Hash. A Hash can also be thought of as a table of elements.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

  pet_store =  {dog_food: 32, cat_food: 32, crates: 12, snacks: 123}   

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

  puts states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

  p states.keys
  p states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

  We could use a hash to hold all customer information related to a credit card account.

  I think hashes are better because they can hold more varied information, adding/removing key-values is easier, and calling values is also easier

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

  I struggled mightily in this section!! WOW. This took so much longer than I expected. I realized that despite spending a good amount of time making notes, reading various tutorials online, and practicing here with exercises, I STILL struggle to add/remove values, call information, and sometimes even create hashes and arrays. I NEED practice, till all this is intuitive. While my immediate goal is to complete the prework, I have definitely created a running list of topics/exercises etc that I need to go back and review. Hashes and arrays are high on that list, because I know these will need to be second nature in Mod 1!
